# Activity Monitor JavaScript Fix - Completed

## Problem Summary
- **Error 1**: `GET http://localhost:8000/js/activityMonitor.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)`
- **Error 2**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: ActivityMonitor is not defined`

## Root Cause
The `activityMonitor.js` file existed in `resources/js/` but:
1. It was not included in Vite's build configuration
2. The layout file was trying to load it using `{{ asset('js/activityMonitor.js') }}` which looks for the file in `public/js/`
3. The file was never compiled or copied to the public directory

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration
**File**: `vite.config.mjs`
- Added `"resources/js/activityMonitor.js"` to the input array
- Now Vite will compile this file during the build process

### 2. Updated Layout File
**File**: `resources/views/admin/layouts/app.blade.php`
- Changed from: `<script src="{{ asset('js/activityMonitor.js') }}"></script>`
- Changed to: `@vite(['resources/js/activityMonitor.js'])`
- This uses Vite's asset handling which properly references the compiled file

### 3. Built Assets
- Ran `npm run build` to compile all assets
- Vite successfully compiled `activityMonitor.js` to `public/build/assets/activityMonitor-CEaGCO8D.js`

## Verification
- ✅ Vite configuration updated
- ✅ Layout file updated to use Vite asset handling  
- ✅ Assets successfully compiled
- ✅ Compiled file exists at `public/build/assets/activityMonitor-CEaGCO8D.js`
- ✅ No other files reference the old asset path

## Expected Result
The errors should now be resolved:
1. The 404 error should disappear because the file is now properly served through Vite
2. The ReferenceError should disappear because the ActivityMonitor class will be loaded before it's used

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Refresh the admin page in your browser
2. Check the browser console for any remaining errors
3. Verify that the activity monitoring functionality works correctly
